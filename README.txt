1. ENPM667: Final Project (Group-8)
	The goal of the project is to design LQR and LQG controllers for a dynamic cart system with two pendulums.

2. Instructions for running code:
	(a) The codes provided in the submission are MATLAB live-script files. They can be executed in MATLAB only. There are no dependencies required.
	(b) All the codes are self-sufficient.
	(c) Only one file 'PartB_PartD_LinearLQR' has the codes for 2 parts together as the name of the file represents. In addition to PartB, it also has the Linear LQR implementation of PartD. Rest of the codes as for single parts as the names suggest.
